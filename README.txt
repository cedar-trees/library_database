My friend owns a lot of books and likes to borrow them out to some of their friends.
They are however quite forgetful and can't always remember who has borrowed what.
By creating this database, they can easily add new books, see which books has been borrowed and see all the people that still has some of their books.

There are three main tables:
The books in their library; labeled as books
The people who have borrowed books; labeled as members
The books that have been borrowed; labeled as borrowed_books

With these tables they can easily query the databse to fetch certain data and easily remember who has borrowed from them.

This file can be easily integrated into most sql databases. 
I decided to code it in python sqlite as this database is very small and can easily be stored directly into the computers memory rather than using a cloud database.

This project features:
 SQLite, 
 SQL methods, 
 Python classes, 
 Data management and retrieval
